Displaying Students (displayAllStudents())
Removing Students by ID (removeStudentById())
Searching Students by ID (searchStudentById())
Function Descriptions:

📌addStudent():
Takes user input for student ID and name.

📌displayAllStudents(): 
Displays all student IDs and names.
Checks if the student list is empty before displaying.

📌removeStudentById():
Searches for a student by ID.
If found, removes the student using vector.erase().
If not found, displays an error message.

📌searchStudentById():
Searches for a student by ID.
If found, displays their details.
If not found, shows an error message.

3️⃣ 3. main() Function
